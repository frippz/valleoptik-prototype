# Valle Optik

Public and open sourced prototype development of Valle Optik.

## Usage

Install dependencies

```zsh
$ npm install
```

Run Gulp

```zsh
$ gulp
```

Prototype files will be built to `/dist`. Feel free to use something like `hs` to serve them, or just open the HTML files directly. Note: this isn’t some damn SPA. 😝
